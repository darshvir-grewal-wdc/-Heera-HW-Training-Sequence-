Steps for 16D Bringup:
	1. Run 25 OQRM on 0C, 25C and 45C on 3 TT samples on 8D.
	2. Check the OQRM cycle # where NAND Temperature saturates.
	3. Run OQRM cycles on:
		a. FF 0C
		b. TT 25C
		c. SS 45C
		till the NAND temperature saturates.
	4. Run the MULT Chaz training on these 3 combinations.
	5. Power cycle the card.
	6. Read the FIM registers for new CALP CALN codes.
	
Observation:
	Check how much delta is between the CALP CALN values at 25C and the saturated temperature for 3 combinations.

	7. Hard code the new CALP CALN codes in init time for the 3 combinations.
	8. Re-run OQRM cycles on:
		a. FF 0C
		b. TT 25C
		c. SS 45C
		till the NAND temperature saturates.
	9. Run the MULT Chaz training on these 3 combinations.

Observation:
	Compare the previous VW sizes to new VW sizes and see the difference.
